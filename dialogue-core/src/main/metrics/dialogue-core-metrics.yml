    docs: General client metrics produced by dialogue. These metrics are meant to be applicable to all conjure clients
          without being implementation-specific.

          Request time split by status and endpoint. Possible status values are:
          * success: 2xx requests, always excludes time spent reading the response body.
          * failure:
            - QoS failures (429, 308, 503)
            - 500 requests
            - IOExceptions
