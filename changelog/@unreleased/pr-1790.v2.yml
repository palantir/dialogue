    Modulate response output writes to 16KiB blocks

    Block size of 16 KB is small enough to allow cipher implementations to become hot and optimize properly when given large inputs. Otherwise large array writes into a javax.crypto.CipherOutputStream fail to use intrinsified implementations. If 16 KB blocks aren't enough to produce hot methods, the I/O is small and infrequent enough that performance isn't relevant.
