    Dialogue validates connections after four seconds of inactivity.

    This value is reduced from twenty seconds, which is longer than
    some servers keepalive timeout. Unfortunately servers with low
    timeouts don't necessarily send keepalive response headers to
    the client describing expected limits.

    Note that this may result in a performance penalty for services
    which often handle traffic in waves as there's a ~1ms cost to
    validate connection health. Timelock, for example, expects to
    make several requests per millisecond per thread, so an increase
    in validation could impede performance.
