    The validateAfterInactivity duration may be modified via a sysprop.
    The `dialogue.experimental.inactivity.check.threshold.millis` property
    can be used to modify the inactivity timeout for connection health
    checks. This is not meant to be a permanent fixture, but to allow
    us to assess the tradeoff between our current four second value and
    a higher value for less frequent hiccups.
