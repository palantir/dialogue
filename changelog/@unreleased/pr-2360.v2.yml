  description: |-
    Dialogue more closely follows the URI specification as defined in [rfc3986 section 3.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-3.3), and allows colons in http paths and query parameters. Previously the `:` character would be encoded as `%3A`, which is also allowed by rfc3986, however not required. Some server implementations, GCP APIs in particular, require colons in path strings not to be encoded.
    This encoding is an implementation detail within dialogue, where either way is valid for servers which are compliant with the rfc. It is possible, though unlikely, that some custom servers or proxies do not handle unencoded colons correctly. Please reach out to us if you find cases where servers do not behave as expected!
