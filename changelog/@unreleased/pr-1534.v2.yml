    Fix Sticky2 early queued response handling.

    Previously the initial response future was mishandled in a way
    that caused cancellation to 'leak' between queued futures, this
    meant that pending responses could be dropped on the floor rather
    than being deserialized as expected.
    Secondly, this fixes an issue in which certain sticky2 requests
    could be retried in error if they fail with an exception after the
    initial request completed with a valid response.
