    Dialogue url encoding escapes Uri sub-delimiter characters.
    The BaseUrl encoder was implemented to strictly follow rfc3986
    URI generic syntax, however it did not take into account the
    [section-3.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.3)
    which describes scheme-specific (http, in our case) reserved
    characters.
    We ensure broader compatibility with existing http infrastructure
    by encoding characters that may be used by some http client and
    server implementations.
