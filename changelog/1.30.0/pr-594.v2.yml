  description: Promote smile encoding to be preferred over json response encoding for more efficient and compat serialization. While our existing infrastructure applies gzip content-compression to responses, the smile format removes the need for CPU-expensive gzip compression in many cases, and allows the compressor to focus on the dynamic data (patterns in the values) in responses that still exceed the compression threshold. In practice we've seen SMILE encoding offer 50% increases in end-to-end performance when large structured objects are involved.
